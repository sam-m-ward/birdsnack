Bayesian Inference of Rv Distributions using SN Ia Apparent Colours at peaK

This pipeline uses:

1) SNooPy to apply K-corrections and Milky Way extinction corrections to SN Ia light curves. 
2) A 2D Gaussian process to interpolate rest-frame photometry to peak time
3) A hierarchial Bayesian model to constrain population distirbutions in intrinsic and extrinsic components.
