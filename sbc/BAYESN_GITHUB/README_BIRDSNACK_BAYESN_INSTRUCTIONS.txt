Greetings 

In folder sbc/BAYESN_GITHUB/ make clones of public github repo's

git clone https://github.com/bayesn/bayesn-model-files.git
git clone git@github.com:bayesn/bayesn-public.git

use the bayesn_model.py file provided in sbc/BAYESN_GITHUB/
copy/paste this into bayesn-public/BayeSNmodel/
this new .py file has very simple modification that allows for RV value to be set/differ from default when simulating new SNe

Finally, download the pysynphot_downloads folder and place in BAYESN_GITHUB
